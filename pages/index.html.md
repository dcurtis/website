title: Sitepress
---

Sitepress is a set of tools that helps you build awesome websites. It is not *solely* a static site generator. It can be embedded in other web frameworks like Rails, it can run stand-alone in a rack server, or you could use it to build your own static site generator.

## Why Sitepress?

Static site generators, like [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), are great frameworks for compiling static websites and publishing them to the web, but what if you need to run a content site from within Rails or Sinatra that needs to have access to a database? There are projects, like [High Voltage](https://github.com/thoughtbot/high_voltage), that make it possible to embed a very basic site into Rails, but it lacks powerful features like Frontmatter and a Sitemap object.

Sitepress is the missing piece. It has all of the features you'd exepect from a static site generator, but is capable of being embedded in Rails, Sinatra, any rack app, or event a static site generator compiler.
