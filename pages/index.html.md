Build amazing content websites in any Ruby web framework including Rails, Sinatra, or even a static site.

## Why Sitepress?

Static site generators, like [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), are great frameworks for compiling static websites and publishing them to the web, but what if you need to run a content site from within Rails or Sinatra?

Database backed content management systems, like [Refinery CMS](http://www.refinerycms.com) and [Radiant CMS](http://radiantcms.org), are difficult to sync between development, test, staging, and production environments making it difficult to fit into multi-stage development or test-driven development work flows.

Projects like [High Voltage](https://github.com/thoughtbot/high_voltage) make it possible to embed a small basic site into Rails, but it lacks powerful features like Frontmatter and a Sitemap API that make building non-trivial content sites possible.

Sitepress is the missing piece. It has all the powerful features you'd expect from a static site generator, like Frontmatter and hierarchal page traversal, but is capable of being embedded in any Rails, Sinatra, or Rack app. Since all of the content is just a bunch of files, its easy to incorporate Sitepress into any multi-stage or test driven work environments.
