Sitepress helps you build amazing content websites in any Ruby web framework *or* stand alone static websites.

## Why Sitepress?

Static site generators, like [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), are great frameworks for compiling static websites and publishing them to the web, but what if you need to run a content site from within Rails or Sinatra that needs to have access to a database? There are projects, like [High Voltage](https://github.com/thoughtbot/high_voltage), that make it possible to embed a very basic site into Rails, but it lacks powerful features like Frontmatter and a Sitemap API to traverse pages.

Database backed content management systems, like [Refinery CMS](http://www.refinerycms.com) and [Radiant CMS](http://radiantcms.org), are difficult to sync between development, test, staging, and production environments making it difficult to fit into multi-stage development or test-driven development workflows.

Sitepress is the missing piece. It has all the powerful features you'd exepect from a static site generator, like Frontmatter, but is capable of being embedded in Rails, Sinatra, any rack app, or event a static site generator compiler.
